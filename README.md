# gRPC talking points
- Really similar to normal serializers
- Have to update the .proto file in both ends
- Typing actually matters

# TODO before presentation
- Postman autoload .protofile or at least share between endpoints
- get_method_serializer not working
- Performance comparison
- How to test
